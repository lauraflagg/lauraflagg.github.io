Characterizing Exoplanet Atmospheres with High-Resolution, Optical Transmission Spectra
======
ExoGemS is using spectra from Gemini-GRACES to characterize exoplanets with a wide range of properties.  One highlight from our survey is the detection of CrH in WASP-31b.

Characterizing Young Exoplanets
======
We used high-resolution spectroscopy from IGRINS to detect CO in the atmosphere of CI Tau b, a planet initially discovered by the radial velocity method in 2016.  Our detection confirms the existence of CI Tau b, making it the youngest confirmed hot Jupiter.  It is also the first planet around a T Tauri star with a dynamic mass measurement.

Gas Dispersal Timescales in Circumstellar Disks
======
Planet formation hinges on the gas present in the disk.  We have looked for (and found!) small amounts of warm molecular hydrogen in disks previously thought to not have warm gas.
