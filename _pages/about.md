I'm Laura Flagg, a research associate (aka a postodc) in astronomy studying transiting exoplanet atmospheres at Cornell University. I also study data-driven telluric corrections and stellar activity. Previously, I earned my PhD with Dr. Christopher Johns-Krull, focusing on planet formation.  We studied the circumstellar environment around young stars as well as observations of young exoplanets.  I also worked with Dr. Evgenya Shkolnik at Lowell Observatory while earning my masters at NAU and Dr. Alycia Weinberger at the Carnegie Institute of Washington.

When I'm not doing research, I like to cuddle with my cats, watch sports, or read a book.
