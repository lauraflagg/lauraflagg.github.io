I'm Laura Flagg, a PhD candidate studying planet formation at Rice University with Dr. Christopher Johns-Krull.  Previously, I worked with Dr. Evgenya Shkolnik at Lowell Observatory while earning my masters at NAU and Dr. Alycia Weinberger at the Carnegie Institute of Washington.

When I'm not doing research, I like to cuddle with my cat, watch sports, or read a book.
